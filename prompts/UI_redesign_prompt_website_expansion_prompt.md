Thoroughly restyle Cinematic Canvas UI in src/client, website, and src/shared/design-system.
The design system is the shared root theme for client and website. It's classes and vaiables ae inherited by both apps.

theme (both):
everything in the UI communicates 'Cinema'
subtle animated gradient backgrounds.
floating opaque elements with rounded corners (think glass brick - blurred with displacement)
headers have large vertical padding (1.5em)
elements have hairline borders with gradient fill
tabs have large vertical padding (1.3em)
Use a single icon library with fine-detail, sharp icons (no rounded lines)
medium padding between content elements (1.2em)
small padding between inline sibling elements (0.7em)
immediate and reponsive mouse over animations in buttons and applicable elements.
text is always crisp and sharp. black or white for content and headings. muted for labels.
card elements have a large and subtle inset shadow and opaque background (dark shadow on top, light shadow on the bottom, creating a refraction look).

theme (website):
website header layout: 
- large cinematic canvas link in left corner
- nav links in top center
- github link in top right

large engaging video hero on root page
video visuals on headers on other pages
(header videos are paused by default, play on hover)

update article list is shown as cover images with title and date overlay in a non-uniform scrolling grid, arranged from newest to oldest. (Think magazines on a tabletop).


effects( both):
button effects: text Content fast-scale, then slow scale (1.1 fast > 1.2 slow)
button effects: button scaleup (1.05) on hover


effects( website):
large subtle gradient mask on root page (subtle vignette effect)

copywrite(website):
Informal, fantastic, grounded headings.
Informative, restrained text body.
Do not alter documentation headings or documentation content.

copywrite(client):
Informative labels.

requirements:
Fast website. Must be immediately responsive to scroll, mousemovement, and keyboard inputs.
