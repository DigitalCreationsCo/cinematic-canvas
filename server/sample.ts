Use reference images as ground truth.\\n- Character count specifications are strict requirements. If '5 characters' specified, all 5 must be visible and distinguishable in every frame where they should appear.\\n- Motion and action verbs specify exact physical movements. 'Sprinting' shows fast running with appropriate biomechanics. 'Walking' shows normal gait. 'Standing' shows stationary position. No ambiguous interpretations.\\n- Temporal state changes accumulate. Wet stays wet until drying scene occurs. Torn stays torn. Dirt accumulates, not disappears. Injuries persist until healing specified.\\n- Camera angles and directions are specified from camera perspective. 'Toward camera' = approaching viewer. 'Away from camera' = receding from viewer. Maintain this perspective.\\n- Background layers specified in composition (crowd, buildings, mountains) are MANDATORY scene elements, not optional. Missing background layers is a critical error.\\n- SURFING TERMINOLOGY: 'barrel' or 'tube' refers to the hollow curved interior of a breaking wave (liquid water forming a tunnel), NOT a physical pipe or solid structure. 'Riding' means actively surfing on moving water, NOT sitting stationary. 'Wipeout' means falling into water, NOT falling on sand.\\n- SURFING ACTIONS: 'Paddling out' shows arms moving in water, 'catching a wave' shows transition from paddling to standing, 'riding' shows active balance and movement on board. All actions must show interaction with liquid water.\\n- OCEAN PHYSICS: Waves are liquid water in motion. Water is translucent/reflective, NOT solid blue or opaque. Breaking waves create spray and foam. Surfboards float on water surface, NOT above or below it artificially.\\n- MOTION AUTHENTICITY: Sports actions (running, jumping, throwing) must show authentic biomechanics with appropriate muscle tension, weight distribution, and momentum. No floating, hovering, or physics-defying poses.\\n- EQUIPMENT HANDLING: Sports equipment must be held and used correctly (proper grip, stance, contact points). Equipment interacts physically with environment (ball bounces, bat hits, racket tension visible).\\n- URBAN AUTHENTICITY: City streets have consistent architectural styles, appropriate traffic density for time of day, logical signage and storefronts. Background pedestrians behave naturally (walking with purpose, looking ahead, normal pace).\\n- URBAN CONTINUITY: Weather effects persist (wet pavement from rain, snow accumulation, puddles). Lighting matches time of day (streetlights on at night, sun position accurate for time).\\n\\n\\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\\nKEYFRAMES PROVIDED:\\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\\n- Start Frame: gs://cinematic-framework-5/video_1765360860268/images/frames/scene_024_frame_start_01.png\\n- End Frame: gs://cinematic-framework-5/video_1765360860268/images/frames/scene_024_frame_end_01.png\\n\\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Generate video matching ALL specifications above\\n- Character appearances MUST match reference images EXACTLY throughout video\\n- Location environment MUST match reference image EXACTLY\\n- Video must transition smoothly from start frame to end frame\\n- Maintain continuity with previous scene\\n- Follow lighting and camera specifications precisely\\n- Duration MUST be exactly 6 seconds\"\n}",

Fade to black.\n\nMood: final\nIntensity: low\nTempo: slow\nMusical Context: The natural decay of the final chord into absolute silence.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nCHARACTERS (Costume & Makeup):\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nLOCATION (Production Design):\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPacific Shores Contest Zone:\n- Type: Beach\n- Description: A bustling California beach hosting a high-stakes surf competition. The scene features a wooden judging tower overlooking the water, bright orange contest buoys bobbing in the turquoise ocean, and crowd barriers set up on the golden sand.\n- Time of Day: morning\n- Weather: Fog\n- Key Elements: Ocean waves, White sea foam, Golden sand, Blue sky, Wooden judging tower, Orange contest buoys, Crowd barriers, Surfboards, Umbrellas\n- Reference Image: Match environment to gs://cinematic-framework-5/video_1765360860268/images/locations/loc_beach_reference.png EXACTLY\nCURRENT STATE (MUST MAINTAIN):\n  - Time of Day: morning\n  - Weather: Fog\n  - Debris: glass\n  - Environmental Damage: explosion\n  - Broken Objects: object breaked\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nCINEMATOGRAPHY:\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nShot Type: VW\nCamera Movement: Static\nCamera Angle: Eye Level\nComposition: Subject Placement: Center, Focal Point: Sun on horizon, Depth Layers: Ocean foreground, horizon midground, sky background\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nLIGHTING (Gaffer):\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n[object Object]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nCONTINUITY (Script Supervisor):\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCONTINUITY FROM PREVIOUS SCENE 26:\n- Previous action: The two Announcers in the wooden tower remove their headsets and sunglasses, laughing as they stack their clipboards. The event is over.\n- Previous lighting: [object Object]\n- Previous mood: resolved\n- Character positions: Maintain spatial logic (if exited left, enters right)\n- Character states: Carry forward any dirt, damage, exhaustion\n- End frame reference: gs://cinematic-framework-5/video_1765360860268/images/frames/scene_026_frame_end_01.png\n\n\n\nSPECIFIC CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS:\n- Sun position lower than previous scenes\n\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nGLOBAL GENERATION RULES:\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n- All character facial features, bone structure, and body proportions must remain pixel-consistent with reference images across all generations. Use reference images as ground truth.\n- Character count specifications are strict requirements. If '5 characters' specified, all 5 must be visible and distinguishable in every frame where they should appear.\n- Motion and action verbs specify exact physical movements. 'Sprinting' shows fast running with appropriate biomechanics. 'Walking' shows normal gait. 'Standing' shows stationary position. No ambiguous interpretations.\n- Temporal state changes accumulate. Wet stays wet until drying scene occurs. Torn stays torn. Dirt accumulates, not disappears. Injuries persist until healing specified.\n- Camera angles and directions are specified from camera perspective. 'Toward camera' = approaching viewer. 'Away from camera' = receding from viewer. Maintain this perspective.\n- Background layers specified in composition (crowd, buildings, mountains) are MANDATORY scene elements, not optional. Missing background layers is a critical error.\n- SURFING TERMINOLOGY: 'barrel' or 'tube' refers to the hollow curved interior of a breaking wave (liquid water forming a tunnel), NOT a physical pipe or solid structure. 'Riding' means actively surfing on moving water, NOT sitting stationary. 'Wipeout' means falling into water, NOT falling on sand.\n- SURFING ACTIONS: 'Paddling out' shows arms moving in water, 'catching a wave' shows transition from paddling to standing, 'riding' shows active balance and movement on board. All actions must show interaction with liquid water.\n- OCEAN PHYSICS: Waves are liquid water in motion. Water is translucent/reflective, NOT solid blue or opaque. Breaking waves create spray and foam. Surfboards float on water surface, NOT above or below it artificially.\n- MOTION AUTHENTICITY: Sports actions (running, jumping, throwing) must show authentic biomechanics with appropriate muscle tension, weight distribution, and momentum. No floating, hovering, or physics-defying poses.\n- EQUIPMENT HANDLING: Sports equipment must be held and used correctly (proper grip, stance, contact points). Equipment interacts physically with environment (ball bounces, bat hits, racket tension visible).\n- URBAN AUTHENTICITY: City streets have consistent architectural styles, appropriate traffic density for time of day, logical signage and storefronts. Background pedestrians behave naturally (walking with purpose, looking ahead, normal pace).\n- URBAN CONTINUITY: Weather effects persist (wet pavement from rain, snow accumulation, puddles). Lighting matches time of day (streetlights on at night, sun position accurate for time).\n- Surfing action verbs must be explicitly defined by body posture to prevent semantic drift: 'Paddling' = lying prone/swimming with arms; 'Riding' = standing; 'Waiting' = sitting upright.\n- For 'Static' shots, explicitly define the camera as 'Tripod Locked-Off' and include a negative constraint against 'panning', 'tilting', or 'drifting' to prevent the model from adding unrequested cinematic motion.\n- Ensure Time of Day specifications are consistent across Location, Gaffer, and Narrative descriptions within a single prompt to prevent conflicting lighting cues (e.g., 'Morning' vs '2:00 PM' vs 'Fading Light').\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nKEYFRAMES PROVIDED:\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n- Start Frame: gs://cinematic-framework-5/video_1765360860268/images/frames/scene_027_frame_start_01.png\n- End Frame: gs://cinematic-framework-5/video_1765360860268/images/frames/scene_027_frame_end_01.png\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Generate video matching ALL specifications above\n- Character appearances MUST match reference images EXACTLY throughout video\n- Location environment MUST match reference image EXACTLY\n- Video must transition smoothly from start frame to end frame\n- Maintain continuity with previous scene\n- Follow lighting and camera specifications precisely\n- Duration MUST be exactly 4 seconds\n",
